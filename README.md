# Introduction
ðŸ“Š **ABC Store Accounting Project** â€” This project simulates the full accounting cycle for a small retail business during its first month of operations. It covers the recording of transactions in T-accounts, the preparation of a Trial Balance, and the creation of both the Income Statement and Balance Sheet.

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of **double-entry bookkeeping**, **financial statement preparation**, and the logical mapping of accounts from the ledger to financial reports.

# Background
This project replicates the workflow of a junior accountant in a small retail environment, ensuring that all transactions are accurately recorded and summarized into financial statements.

### Key Questions Addressed:
1. How are daily transactions posted to T-accounts following the double-entry principle?
2. How do you prepare a Trial Balance to check the equality of debits and credits?
3. How do you map Trial Balance accounts to produce a complete Income Statement and Balance Sheet?

# Tools I Used
- **Microsoft Excel:** Used for T-account preparation, Trial Balance calculation, and financial statement formatting.
- **Formulas:** Applied `SUM()` for account totals, manual debit/credit balancing, and cross-checks.
- **Pivot Tables:** Used for quick summarization of account balances before mapping to statements.
- **Accounting Principles:** Double-entry bookkeeping, classification of accounts, and mapping to IS/BS.

# The Analysis

### 1. Recording Transactions in T-Accounts
All business transactions from the first month were entered into the correct T-accounts, applying **debit** and **credit** rules based on account type:

**Example entries:**
- Investment of $10,000 cash:
    - Debit: Cash $10,000  
    - Credit: Ownerâ€™s Equity $10,000
- Purchase of inventory on credit for $2,500:
    - Debit: Inventory $2,500  
    - Credit: Accounts Payable $2,500
- Sale of inventory costing $1,000 for $1,200 cash:
    - Debit: Cash $1,200  
    - Credit: Revenue $1,200  
    - Debit: Cost of Goods Sold $1,000  
    - Credit: Inventory $1,000

This ensured the accounting equation **Assets = Liabilities + Ownerâ€™s Equity** remained balanced.

### 2. Preparing the Trial Balance
After closing all T-accounts, a Trial Balance was prepared with two columns â€” **Debit** and **Credit** â€” to confirm that total debits equal total credits.

Purpose:
- Detect posting errors.
- Verify that all ledger entries were transferred correctly from the journal.

### 3. Mapping to Financial Statements
The Trial Balance accounts were mapped to the correct **Financial Statement Line Items (FSLIs)**:

| Financial Statement | Section              | FSLI             |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Balance Sheet       | Current Assets       | Cash             |
| Balance Sheet       | Current Assets       | Accounts Receivable |
| Balance Sheet       | Current Assets       | Inventory        |
| Balance Sheet       | Current Liabilities  | Accounts Payable |
| Balance Sheet       | Current Liabilities  | Unearned Revenue |
| Balance Sheet       | Equity               | Ownerâ€™s Equity   |
| Income Statement    | Revenue              | Sales Revenue    |
| Income Statement    | COGS                 | Cost of Goods Sold |
| Income Statement    | SG&A                  | Rent Expense     |
| Income Statement    | SG&A                  | Office Supplies  |
| Income Statement    | SG&A                  | Salaries         |
| Income Statement    | SG&A                  | Utilities        |

This mapping enabled the automatic creation of the **Income Statement** and **Balance Sheet** for the period.

# What I Learned
- ðŸ§¾ **Full Cycle Accounting:** Practiced recording transactions, balancing T-accounts, and preparing statements.
- ðŸ“Š **Trial Balance Checks:** Reinforced how a trial balance works to detect posting errors.
- ðŸ§© **Account Mapping:** Improved ability to map accounts to financial statements logically and accurately.
- ðŸ’¡ **Excel Accounting Workflow:** Learned how to streamline bookkeeping using Excel formulas and pivot tables.

# Conclusions

### Key Insights
1. Maintaining the accounting equation in every transaction is crucial to producing accurate financial statements.
2. A Trial Balance is a powerful tool for spotting potential posting mistakes before preparing final reports.
3. Mapping accounts correctly to financial statements is essential for clarity and compliance.

### Closing Thoughts
This project strengthened my foundational accounting skills while leveraging Excel to simulate the month-end close process. It reflects both the technical and procedural competencies needed for junior accounting or financial analyst roles.
